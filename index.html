                My name is Justin, I'm a man all about self improvement. <br>
                My joy in life comes from finding a challenge and enjoying the journey
                to conquer it. Any hobby I've attempted it has been my obsession to become
                atleast better than average. Programming happens to be the holy grail of "continually
                getting better and improving", and it just so happens it is a valuable skill
                that actively makes the lives of myself and others better.
