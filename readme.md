# Portfolio Website

---

Portfolio website acting as a replacement for a resume that I can show people when they ask what I do. I was inspired by [https://jaydensipe.github.io](https://jaydensipe.github.io/) to create this website. One of the key differences is I intend to incorporate some of my projects into separate pages so that users can interact with what I’ve created.

## Key Features

---

- 3 sections
    - “About me” summarizing my goals.
    - Projects
    - Certifications
- Website based projects (like the ones from freecodecamp) should be embedded as separate interactable pages into the website.
- Clean, smooth animations
- Contact info

## Issues to solve

---

- “navigation” bar doesn’t properly scale for different browser sizes.
